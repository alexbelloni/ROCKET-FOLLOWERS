ROCKET FOLLOWERS for NASA Space Apps 2018

Do You Know When the Next Rocket Launch Is?

How could I watch a rocket launch in person or online?

Launches are awesome but losing this event could be terrible.

The Datanauts team built "Rocket Followers" which is a solution to know launches' details, its spaceports, transmissions, statistics, and its reentries.

We created it by using a large group of APIs and datasets, linking this information.

Now, you can plan your trip or save the date to watch it online, using a friendly and intuitive tool.
